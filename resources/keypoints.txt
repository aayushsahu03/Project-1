why recommendation system?
cognition at core of the business.
look at overall customer journey
Then run campaign to bring in more customer and engage
better customer experience through personalization, navigation 
from search till checkout


1.Rule based recommendation engine
->  suppose a product is frequently bought by majority of customers, the system will learn that is msot popular and recommend
->  Popularity based does not have cold start problem but it is not personalized
    to every new user which has joined

2.Market Basket Analysis (Bundling)
->  Apriori algorithm is implemented Using itemsets.
->  Confidence support and lift. 
->  FP growth algorithm (frequent pattern)

3.Content Based
->  Content based filtering based item description and user profile
->  cosine similaritity 
->  Keywords are used. field of information retrieval

4.Hybrid model
->  solve typical issues in recommendation such as cold start and sparsity 

5. clustering
->  cluster customers based on product liking

6. classification
->  The model that uses features of both products as well 
    as users to predict whether a user will like a product or not
->  application buyer propensity model
->  Propensity modeling attempts to predict the likelihood that visitors, leads,
    and customers will perform certain actions
-> RFM based features

7. Deep learning models
->  lightfm hybrid recommender system (single model rather 2 models)
->  capture text or product description -NLP, tfidf, description to features
->  To capture semantic meaning use word2vec, BERT, Transformers
->  DNN (Deep nerual networks), CNN (Convolutional neural network)
->  RBM, autoencoder based recommendation system
->  library- Tensorvec

8. Knowledge graph based recommendation
->  Knowledge craft connects users and items through different relationships to 
    obtain an explanable candidate list for target user.
->  KGE (Knowledge graph embedding)

__________________________________________________________

Data and similaritity measures:

1. user behaviour data
->  user's involvemnt in a product
->  ratings, clicks, purchase history can all be used

2. User demographic data
->  User demographic information is related to age, education, income an location

3. Product attribute data
->  Product attribute data refers to information on the product itself,
    genre
